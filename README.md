## Restruant System(laravel)

Here is my project again it called Restruant System.
It has two main sections.I used jetstream for this project. Kitchen panel and Waiter panel.
Kitchen create dishes tables and prepare what customer order.
In waiter panel waiter take order from customer and send to kitchen panel.
When order is ready, waiter can serve that order to customers.
After having dishes waiter take bill from customers and that total revenue are added to
profit table on database.

### Api section
I use sanctum auth for api auth process.You can do all process from UI at api. If you want to test api you can clone this project.
In routes folder at api.php I wrote documation about how to use my api.
Hope this will helpfull for you.
